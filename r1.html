        <h1>How do people differ from each other</h1>
        <p style="color:pink;background-color:purple;">
            Everyone id unique and has distinguished sence of humor and emotions with varrying extent of emotions and behaviour.

            People are different, everyone thinks differently, has different characteristics people act differently, no one is the same in this world. This is good, but some of the time young people do things they regret later, sometimes they can’t control what they do, other times they do things to get respect from other people. One of these things I am talking about is fighting between other fellow peoples.
            When I was at the age of 9, I saw my first fight between two of my best friends. It all started approximately 3 weeks before the actual fight with a silly name calling game which turned very bad. One day both of these very close friends were in a classroom together with a group of other students in the same room, one person started to call another a name to get recognized by other students as being ‘big' and win respect from them. The two friends were the same age, and strength and didn't want to look bad in front of the other students, so the two friends said a comment back to each other in defense. It started off as a small game, but by the end of the class, it was getting serious. This continued for about 3 weeks, then one day they were in the same class as each other, again throwing comments at each other when one said to the other; "let’s take this outside". Everyone around them urged them to fight so after the class that's exactly what they did. Arms were flying everywhere, the other students were shouting anger at them to hurt each other more, and more.
            I remember standing there helplessly wanting to stop them, but knew if I got involved I would most probably be suspended for interfering. This made me sad, for I didn't have any control of any of my good friends.

    <h1>Emotions</h1>
    <p>
        There are different people belonging to different cultures over the world. It is good to interact and learn these different languages. Through learning the languages, you can interact indirectly meaning it is not necessary to meet physically with these people but through learning their language. Learning of different languages is through different ways; we can learn these languages as subjects in class, which forms an indirect interaction with the people possessing it. We can as well learn the language by direct interaction, this means meeting with the language speakers.

In my county, we have some languages offered in class as optional and others are compulsory. The learning of these languages is truly indirect way of interacting with the speakers of the language. We have English as one of the compulsory language in class. This language is the one that we use for communication. It is very important because it links all people together irrespective of their tradition and cultures. Many people do not use English as their first language. Therefore, it is good to learn it in Oder to facilitate learning and to link up people from different cultures and tradition. Without knowing English, people would still live the traditional way where they retain their tradition and culture to maintain effective communication between them.

Some other languages in our study system are optional, French and Germany are some of the languages that are in our study system. These languages are equally important but because English is already compulsory and mostly used in many countries worldwide our education, system made it compulsory to learn it. Germany and French languages are optional and therefore it takes upon the interest of a pupil or student. I consider it that not only the interest that should prompt someone to learn a certain language but the benefits attached it.

The importance of learning of learning different languages

There are many advantages attached to learning languages. In our daily living, we have many activities to undertake and we are interdependent.
